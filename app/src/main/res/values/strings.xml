    <string name="GD">Group discussion is a new trend that has come up in order to evaluate student personality. A group of participants are made to discuss on a topic or subject for a limited time and then assessed accordingly. It is a chance for you to be more vocal.

\nThere are a lot of advantages of a group discussion:
1.It helps to shed away the shyness of a candidate and brings his viewpoint amidst all.\n

2.It stimulates to think in a different, new way.

\n3.It helps the candidate in understanding his/ her own strengths and weaknesses.

\n4.It acts as an aid in expansion of the knowledge of the participant.

\n5.It helps to analyse the social or economic issues more logically.

Here is a list of what should be done and what should be avoided at a Group Discussion (GD)

\n1.Be as natural as possible. Do not try to be someone you are not. Be yourself. In an attempt to be someone else, your opinions will not be portrayed.

\n2.Sit with a straight and confident posture.

\n3.Be assertive yet humble. You need to stick to your values and beliefs, but learn to respect the values and opinions of others too.

\n4.Grab the opportunity to speak first, i.e. to start the group discussion with your opinion. It generally leaves a good impression on the evaluator, but take the move only if you have complete knowledge of the subject.

\n5.Do not repeat a point, or be lengthy or irrelevant. Also intervene, if someone else is going on an irrelevant track.</string>
